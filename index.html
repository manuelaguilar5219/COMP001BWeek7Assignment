    <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
    <p>I would say most things worked well at the start of the class. It did become more difficult towards the end but I was able to get help by asking questions about it.</p>
    <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
    <p>I'm not sure what I would change specifically. I thought it was fine.</p>
    <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h1>
    <p>Yeah I think I did, coming into the class I just assumed it was gonna be editing stuff in CSS but like more details about it and different changes that could be made.</p>
    <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
    <p>The main concept that was new to me was Bootstrap. Most of the things I had already encountered were just the simple things we did in the html class when it came to CSS.</p>
